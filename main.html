                      <p><u>Which stage can you relate to?</u></p>
                      <p> <b>Early Years: </b> <i> infancy to Preschool (Ages 0-5)</i></p>
                      <p>During these formative years, bonding activities often revolve around sensory experiences and nurturing routines</p>
        
                      <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li><p><b>Cuddle and Playtime:</b> Engage in gentle play, cuddling, and exploring textures through soft toys and sensory activities.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Storytime:</b> Read colorful books, encouraging interaction through pointing at pictures and making sounds.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Creative Play:</b> Experiment with finger painting, playdough, and simple crafts, promoting creativity and motor skills development.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Outdoor Adventures:</b> Stroll in the park, allowing the child to experience nature and different stimuli.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    
        
                      <p>In the infancy and preschool stages, the constant care and attention required by young children can be physically and emotionally draining for mothers. Sleep deprivation and the challenges of meeting the child's needs can lead to increased stress and feelings of overwhelm. However, the tender moments and cuddles also provide emotional fulfillment, creating a mix of joy and exhaustion.</p>
                   
                      <p> <b>Primary School Years: </b> <i> Ages 6-12</i></p>
                      <p>As children grow, their interests and abilities expand, leading to more diverse bonding experiences.</p>
                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li><p><b>Cooking Together:</b> Involve children in age-appropriate cooking activities, fostering a sense of accomplishment and teaching life skills.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Family Game Nights:</b> Play board games or video games together, promoting healthy competition and teamwork.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Shared Hobbies:</b> Encourage shared hobbies like gardening, painting, or playing musical instruments, fostering mutual interests.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Sports and Outdoor Activities:</b> Participate in sports or outdoor adventures, enhancing physical well-being and family bonding.</p></li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <p>As children enter primary school, mothers often find more time for themselves as kids become more independent. Engaging in enjoyable bonding activities can reduce stress and promote relaxation. However, the pressures of academic and social challenges that children face might also cause mothers to worry, affecting their mental well-being. I am at this stage at the moment and I am finding that taking things slowly and saying no to invitations that limit our time to rest and relax make things more manageable. </p>
                    <p> <b>High School and Adolescence:  </b> <i> Ages 13-18</i></p>
                    <p>During the teenage years, bonding activities focus on mutual respect, open communication, and supporting independence.</p>
        
                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li><p><b>Heart-to-Heart Talks:</b> Engage in meaningful conversations, actively listening to their thoughts, concerns, and dreams.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Joint Projects: </b> Collaborate on home improvement projects, DIY crafts, or planning family vacations, encouraging teamwork and responsibility.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Encourage Independence: </b> Support their passions and hobbies, even if they differ from yours, respecting their individuality and fostering self-esteem.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The journey of mom and kids bonding is a continuous process of adaptation and understanding. By recognizing the unique needs and interests of children at different stages of their development, mothers can create lasting connections that withstand the test of time. Whether itâ€™s through playful interactions in early childhood, shared hobbies in primary school, or deep conversations in adolescence, the evolving nature of these activities enriches the bond, making it a source of strength and support for both mothers and their children. Accepting these transitions with love and openness paves the way for a strong and enduring relationship that lasts a lifetime.</p>

                <i class="material-icons right">close</i></span>
               <p>Welcoming your baby into the world is a beautiful and amazing experience, but for many migrant mothers living far from their immediate family, the journey into motherhood can be exceptionally challenging. </p> 
              <p><b><i>If you are a migrant mother who had unique hurdles during the postpartum period, read on and feel free to share your story with us.</i></b></p>
              <p>From the lack of emotional and physical support to the profound impact it can have on their mental health, let's look into the realities of postpartum for these courageous women.</p>  
              <p><b>The Isolation of Childbirth</b></p>
              <p>Migrant mothers often lack the comforting presence of their family during childbirth. This isolation can intensify the feelings of vulnerability and fear, leading to a stressful birthing experience. Particularly in Australia, househelp isn't readily available. If you are on maternity leave, the cost of doula can go up to $1000AUD which surely hurts the family budget during this time. </p>
            
              <p><b>Absence of Emotional Support</b></p>
           
              <p>One of the fundamental challenges faced by migrant mothers is the absence of emotional support. The inability to share the joys and challenges of motherhood with family members can lead to feelings of loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. I was one of those lucky people who had my own mother with me two weeks post giving birth. I had to fly her to Melbourne from overseas but due to her work, she only stayed for a few weeks and went back home. The entire time she was around, I had less mental burden but as soon as she left, it just felt overwhelming and tough in all aspects. </p>
              <p><b>Physical Exhaustion and Limited Rest</b></p>
              
              <p>Without family around, simple tasks like getting adequate rest become monumental challenges. Sleep deprivation can exacerbate postpartum fatigue, making it harder for mothers to cope with the demands of parenthood. This is most especially true for breastfeeding mothers, those with clingy children or those whose children have medical conditions. Do you remember how much rest you got during this time? I bet you will all agree it wasn't a lot.</p>
              <p><b>Cultural and Language Barriers</b></p>
           
              <p>Migrant mothers might find it difficult to communicate their needs effectively due to language barriers. Additionally, cultural differences in parenting practices can lead to misunderstandings and feelings of inadequacy. I was advised by my maternal nurse to let the baby "self-soothe" while they are crying. This means to leave them on their own if they cry and not to carry or hold them. I was told to let them sleep in their own room too. I understand that this is due to SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) which occurs when the mom and bub co-sleep. But due to cultural differences, being raised by Asian family, I kept my babies next to me in bed. </p>
              <p><b>Financial Strain and Limited Resources</b></p>
             
              <p>Financial constraints can restrict access to essential postpartum resources such as healthcare, childcare assistance, and counseling services. Limited resources can exacerbate stress, making it difficult for mothers to seek the help they need. In Australia, the government provided a baby bonus for non-working mothers upon giving birth. It was $5000 during my time, spread across 4 months, paid fortnightly. This may sound a lot but if you are taking maternity leave for more than 4 months, this budget won't be enough. If you are employed, maternity leave pay depends on your employer. Regardless, I believe new mothers, especially after Covid, is experiencing an even worse financial issues given the price hike of common grocery items including baby formula and nappies. The decision whether to put them in childcare or work part time is also a daunting stage for new mothers. The cost of childcare in Australia ranges from $70-$200 per week.  </p>
              <p><b>Impact on Mental Health</b></p>
              
              <p>The lack of emotional and physical support, coupled with the stressors of adapting to a new environment, significantly increases the risk of postpartum depression and anxiety among migrant mothers. The constant pressure to be a perfect parent without a support system can take a toll on mental well-being. There is also a bigger pressure now for new mothers to "bounce back" after birth and have their pre-baby body back. This is an unnecessary pressure that we put on new mothers lately and we should really promote a better campaign especially for our future generation. Our campaign should be more on recovery process, open community discussion (face to face or virtual) and also letting our new mothers be heard on their struggles rather than imposing our own experiences on them. Sometimes, it is enough to be heard to unload the heavy weight we carry inside of us.  </p>
              <p><b>Coping Strategies and Resilience</b></p>
            
              <p>Despite the challenges, many migrant mothers develop remarkable resilience. A lot of us have effective coping strategies, able to find supportive communities, and even more open in seeking professional help in their postpartum experience. Encouraging migrant mothers to connect with local support groups, community organizations, and online forums can provide them with a sense of belonging and emotional sustenance. Building friendships with other mothers who understand their journey can be incredibly empowering. </p>
              <p>Migrant mothers deserve acknowledgment, understanding, and support as they navigate the intricate path of postpartum without their immediate family by their side. By raising awareness about their challenges and fostering inclusive communities, we can create a more compassionate and supportive environment for these brave women, ensuring they receive the care and understanding they need during this transformative period in their lives.

                <i class="material-icons right">close</i></span>
               <p>If you have children, have you observed how gentle melodies can calm a crying infant and aid in better sleep? Do you remember carrying your babies in the middle of the night, rocking them to sleep while you, sleep-deprived and exhausted, starts humming until your baby falls back asleep? If you are at this stage right now, keep humming and keep going. The nights are long but the years are short. I know it is tough, but keep going and put your favourite music on. If you have gone past this stage, this memory can make you feel nostalgic. Sometimes I wonder, how did we survive? But the answer is simple, it is our love for our children and the melody of life that kept us going. Our national anthem to put my first child to sleep was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Do you remember yours?</p>

            <p>There is also a fascinating connection between music and fetal development. When I was pregnant with my first child, I used to read books and sing to my belly at every opportunity I get. At the later stage of my pregnancy, some may say it is coincidence, but whenever music plays, the kicks also happen. At 6 months, she was making cooing noise when she hears music. Today at 10 years old, she fills up our house with music and lyrics every day. Her love for words also inspires her to write stories.</p>

            <p>There is also an uplifting role music plays in combating postpartum depression. Are you one of those first-time mothers who found solace and strength through music therapy? I think pregnancy and motherhood can be isolating at times but music allows us to navigate the challenging waters of motherhood with resilience. During this period, mothers have a lot to say to their children but through music, we can all express what we want to say. </p>

            <p>Moms with teenage kids might be experiencing this differently. I think for them it is more of getting accustomed to the songs their teenagers like, taking them to concerts and adjusting to the genre their children prefer. If you are a Spice Girl fan, remember the song Mama? I was a teenager at that time and whenever I sing that song, my mom used to love it.  </p>

            <p>Music also foster creativity and fun  that both mothers and babies can enjoy. From simple shakers to homemade drums, these creative endeavors not only stimulate a baby's senses but also provide mothers with a playful outlet.</p>

            <p>In times of adversity, these healing harmonies serve as a guiding light, nurturing the emotional well-being of both moms and children. Through the universal language of music, families find strength, resilience, and the enduring power to overcome life's challenges, one melodious note at a time. Xoxo</p>

                    <p><b>Social Expectations</b></p>
                   <p><b>Fear of Judgement:</b> Women often fear being judged for their appearance, choices, and actions. Society imposes unrealistic standards, leading to self-doubt and anxiety, which can severely impact mental health. In my previous blog entry, I mentioned about the expectation of new mothers to "bounce back" after giving birth and for them to appear they've got everything under control. Failing to do so can mean they aren't good enough or lazy or not caring enough for their body. All of these are unrealistic and does nothing but add pressure. </p>
    
                  
                   <p><b>Fear of Failure: </b> Expectations of perfection in various roles, such as being a perfect mother, wife, or professional, can instill a fear of failure. This fear can lead to stress and burnout, affecting mental well-being. This is true for all women no matter what choice you make in life. Society dictates, by a certain age, you should have a stable job, married with children. Failure to do so means you are behind. But behind what and who exactly? You choose to be a housewife - you aren't contributing financially. You work - you aren't taking care of your family. Seriously.  </p>
                   
                   <p><b>Personal experiences</b></p>
                   <p><b>Fear of Abuse:</b> Many women have experienced or fear experiencing physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. Traumatic experiences can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues. These experiences affect our choices in relationships whether it is friendship, platonic or romantic. This can either make us shut down from people or make us so vulnerable. If this happened to you, speak up and find a community or a group who can support you. Start making these abusers accountable for what they've done and don't stay silent forever.  </p>

                   <p><b>Fear of Harassment: </b> The fear of harassment in public spaces or online can create constant anxiety. Persistent fear can lead to social withdrawal and heightened stress levels, impacting mental health negatively. We should always be vigilant of our surroundings as much as possible. Whether you are at a parking lot, recreation parks and centers, parties or events, always be alert. Protect your body at all costs and teach your children to do the same. </p>
                    
                   <p><b>Cultural Norms</b></p>
                   <p><b>Fear of Disempowerment: </b>Cultural norms in some societies can limit womenâ€™s rights and opportunities. Fear of disempowerment and lack of agency can lead to feelings of helplessness and depression. This can be true in our working environment. Make sure you know the group who address poor or inappropriate workplace behavior at your company and seek support from them whenever needed. </p>

                   <p><b>Fear of Stigmatization: </b>Women facing mental health challenges often fear being stigmatized. This fear can prevent them from seeking help, exacerbating their mental health issues. A lot of women have stayed silent while the perpetrators continue on living normally in their life. Let's change this for our future generation. If you don't report, no one will know what truly happened. But if you stand up and speak up, your voice will make a difference. In today's society, there are a lot of victims who are stepping out to the light making the abusers pay for their actions. The overflowing support not only from friends and family members but also the women-led political and social groups are encouraging more and more women to do the same.</p>

                   <p><b>Empowering Women and Fostering Mental Well-being</b></p>
                    <p><b>Let's Talk it Out: </b>Creating safe spaces for women to share their fears and experiences can reduce the stigma surrounding these issues. Open dialogue fosters empathy and understanding, crucial for mental health support.</p>

                    <p><b>Let us Access Mental Health Services: </b>If you have mental health services that are accessible, affordable, and free from judgment, use them. Women must have easy access to therapy, counseling, and support groups and this plays a vital role in our mental wellness. </p>

                    <p><b>Let's Challenge Stereotypes:</b>Challenging societal norms and stereotypes is essential. Education and awareness campaigns can promote acceptance and understanding, helping women overcome societal pressures and fears. The generation of women today faces much more scrutiny especially from online trolls and so the more women are needed to promote acceptance and empathy at every chance we get. The internet is a powerful tool to reach a broader audience and even a small positive message can make a greater impact on whoever needs to hear it. </p>

                    <p><b>Promoting Self-Care: </b>Encouraging self-care practices, such as mindfulness, meditation, and physical activity, can empower women to manage stress and anxiety effectively. This is a special shoutout to all women, especially to all the moms out there to please take good care of your well-being. I don't mean make up and expensive spas but more on moments that take you back to your happy place. This could be reading, drinking your coffee while it is hot, taking a warm bath, watching a sunset, taking a walk. Do something every day that takes you back to your happy mood. Anything, anything at all. </p>

                    <p>By acknowledging these fears, challenging societal norms, and promoting mental health awareness, we can empower women to overcome their fears and thrive mentally, emotionally, and socially. Together, let's break the chains of fear and build a more inclusive, understanding, and mentally healthy world for all.</p>

                            <p><b>Have you heard of Bell's Palsy? </b></p>
                            
                            <p>October 2012, it was a typical Saturday morning, I went to the gym, did boxing and cooled down by swimming at the gym pool. A friend rang asking if I was free to join them for lunch and I immediately agreed. We met at the restaurant and while reading the menu, I felt like something was poking my right eye. It felt as if an eyelash got stuck in it so I went to the washroom and rinsed my right eye out. </p>

                            <p>The food came out, my eye was feeling a bit dry so I started blinking excessively during the entire meal. I told my friend it's very uncomfortable but when she checked my eye, there was nothing in it. We went to my place after lunch and around 2:00PM, my friend said something funny but for some odd reason only the left side of my face was moving. I couldn't smile properly. </p>

                            <p>"Am I having a stoke?" I asked my friend. Lucky to have her around, she is a licensed nurse so she checked my body movement and said "No", it seems like a Bell's palsy. </p>
                            <p><b>Bell's Palsy</b>is a sudden facial paralysis that can strike anyone at any time. It is a neurological condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It occurs due to the inflammation of the facial nerve, leading to facial drooping, difficulty in closing the eye, and challenges in smiling or speaking. Bell's Palsy affects not only the physical aspects of a person's life but also casts a profound shadow on their mental well-being. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>How does Bell's Palsy affect your mental health?</p>
                             
                            <ul>
                              <li><b>Identity and Self-Esteem:</b>The sudden change in facial appearance can lead to a loss of confidence and self-esteem, causing individuals to withdraw from social interactions.</li>
                              <li><b>Social Isolation:</b> Fear of judgment or misinterpretation by others can result in social withdrawal, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.</li>
                              <li><b>Depression and Anxiety:</b>Coping with the physical symptoms and societal pressures can trigger symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders.</li>
                              <li><b>Communication Challenges:</b>Difficulty in speaking clearly can cause frustration and anxiety, hindering effective communication and leading to feelings of helplessness</li>
                              <li><b>Impact on Relationships:</b>Close relationships may be strained due to communication difficulties and emotional distress, affecting both the individual and their loved ones.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><b>What can we do during this challenging period?</b></p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><b>Seeking Support:</b>Keep an open communication with friends, family, and mental health professionals who can provide a crucial support network. Depending on severity, you might be in pain and it will stop you from doing your usual routine. Don't hesitate to ask family members or friends to assist in your daily tasks while recovering. </li>
                              <li><b>Therapy and Counseling:</b>Therapy sessions can help individuals manage anxiety and depression related to their condition. The use of video calls and phone consult has given us a much more easier access to healthcare. Bell's palsy affects the eye and I wouldn't recommend driving for safety reasons. Having a Telehealth or videocall session with your therapist gives you a much better way of accessing medical services from the comfort of your home. </li>
                              <li><b>Building Resilience:</b>Engage in activities that promote self-confidence, such as hobbies and creative pursuits, can rebuild self-esteem and a sense of identity. This is an opportunity for you to give your whole body the care and love it needs. During recovery, you can do facial and neck massages using your gua sha or facial oils with scents that relax your senses. You can also have a relaxing bath, do soft head hand, head and foot massages. It reminds you that while your face is mending, the rest of your body parts are well and healthy. </li>
                              <li><b>Support Groups:</b>If you are comfortable, you can join support groups with others who have experienced or are experiencing Bell's Palsy can provide a sense of community and understanding. There are online communities available in social medias and websites that could make you feel heard and understood by those people having the same challenges.</li>
                              <li><b>Educating Others:</b>Post recovery, you can choose to raise awareness about Bell's Palsy and its emotional impact that can reduce stigma and foster understanding among peers and the community.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Bell's Palsy is not just a physical condition; it's a challenge that tests one's emotional strength and resilience. By acknowledging the mental health implications and providing empathy, understanding, and appropriate support, we can help individuals facing Bell's Palsy navigate their journey to recovery with dignity, confidence, and renewed mental well-being.</p>

                                            <p>Since Covid hit, financial stress has become an unwelcome companion for many. The constant pressure to make ends meet, pay bills, and plan for the future can weigh heavily on our shoulders, impacting not only our wallets but also our mental well-being. There is a profound connection between financial stress and mental health, so join me in exploring the roots of this issue and discovering empowering ways to alleviate its burden.</p>

                                            <p>Financial stress doesnâ€™t just affect our bank accounts, it infiltrates our minds and emotions, often leading to anxiety, depression, and a diminished quality of life. The uncertainty of financial stability can create a cycle of worry, affecting our ability to focus, sleep, and enjoy life. The stress can strain relationships and erode self-esteem, leaving individuals feeling trapped and overwhelmed.</p>
                                            
                                            <p><b><u>Why do we have this problem?</u></b></p>
                                            <ul>
                                              <li><b>Living Beyond Means:</b> Uncontrolled spending and accumulating debt can create a constant state of worry. One of the easiest ways to get into debts is the intention to "keep up with the Joneses". Our lifestyle should not be based on what we see on others, we can try living within our means and if we find we are spending more than what we earn, we can start looking at budgeting and sticking to it. </li>
                                              <li><b>Job Insecurity:</b> Fear of losing a job or not finding employment can create persistent stress and anxiety. Since Covid started, plenty of people lost their jobs particularly those from tourism, retail and small businesses. There were also others who decided to move to "pandemic-proof" industries and roles in the fear of losing their profession if pandemic hits again. </li>
                                              <li><b>Lack of Financial Literacy:</b> Limited knowledge about managing finances can lead to poor decisions and increased stress. Cyber-attacks have been spreading like a plague and one of the ways you lose your finances is by giving out your financial details to unfamiliar sites or links. Be very mindful in doing this as you can lose your entire savings by making this simple mistake. 
                                              </li>
                                              <li><b>Unexpected Expenses:</b>Medical emergencies or sudden repairs can disrupt financial plans, causing immense stress. Incidental expenses also puts a lot of pressure on us especially if our savings are drained and unfortunate events happen one after the other. It is important for every invidividual to do their best to save, no matter how little, for the coming rainy days. </li>
                                              <li><b>Social Pressures:</b>Comparing oneself to othersâ€™ lifestyles and financial successes can breed feelings of inadequacy and stress. With the use of social media, it is very easy to feel jealous of other people's vacations, houses, cars and other material things. But remembering social media posts are only highlights and not providing us the complete picture of someone else's life can have a positive impact in our financial decisions. </li>
                              
                                            </ul>
                                          
                                            <p><b><u>What we can try:</u></b></p>

                                            <ul>
                                              <li><b>Financial Education:</b>Invest time in understanding budgeting, saving, and investing. Knowledge is empowering and can help make informed decisions. Read financial books or watch finance videos made by investors or business managers who have proven methods and results.</li>
                                              <li><b>Budgeting and Saving: </b> Create a realistic budget and stick to it. Establish an emergency fund to handle unexpected expenses, providing a sense of security. A small amount of $10, $30, $50, when accumulated in time can give you a sense of security in times of needs. Do you have gym membership but you don't go regularly? Cancel it and swap it with home exercises. Do you have subscriptions you don't use? Cancel it. Anything outside of your needs, if you are in a tight budget, get them off your bills and get them later once you are in a better financial position. </li>
                                              <li><b>Seek Professional Help:</b>Consult financial advisors or counselors who can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.</li>
                                              <li><b>Mindfulness and Stress Management: </b>Practice mindfulness meditation, yoga, or other relaxation techniques to manage stress and promote mental well-being.</li>
                                              <li><b>Open Communication:</b>Discuss financial concerns openly with family or close friends. Supportive relationships can alleviate the emotional burden. Carefully choose the people you share your financial burden with. Make sure they are trustworthy and will not add into your mental load. </li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p>Financial stress is a formidable opponent, but armed with knowledge and support, it can be managed effectively. By addressing the root causes, seeking financial education, and nurturing mental well-being, we can break free from the chains of financial stress. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, and with the right tools and mindset, a financially stable and mentally resilient future is within reach.</p>
